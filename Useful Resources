In general it is much better to learn new words with a learner's dictionary than a billingual dictionary. 
A learner's dictionary gives the meaning of words using simple English words so that an intermediate student of 
English can understand it.

Ngrams and frequency comparisons are also useful tools. These can help you decide which collocation (word pair) is 
correct or how frequently a saying or idiom is actually used. Netspeak is more useful when you have a question about
a single word. Search [do make] a mistake, and which word is correct will be obvious. I find Google ngrams more useful
for comparing full phrases.
