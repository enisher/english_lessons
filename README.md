# english_lessons
Welcome to my collaborative English learner project! 

The goal of this project is to collect materials such as videos, podcasts, grammatical explanations and anything else that are useful to those learning English. Rather than simply posting a collection of raw links, lists of unfamiliar words with definitions, complicated structures or other linguistic features can be highlighted so that future learners and teachers can more effectively use each resource.
